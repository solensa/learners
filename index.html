            Historically in the Group we’ve used job profiles to manage recruitment, HR and the nature of our roles. Over time the sheer quantity of job profiles meant that many were outdated, others lacked clear accountabilities and required capabilities, and ultimately there was no consistency across the Group.

          <div class="contentPanelSubtitle">Enter Job Families</div>
          <div class="contentPanelTextBlock">
            In November 2019, after going through existing job profiles and analysing the wider job market, Job Families were brought in to solve these issues. To simplify and bring consistency to the way jobs are defined, Job Families introduced a flat hierarchy of roles, a single source of accountabilities and capabilities, and a consistent format and language.
